Yes, this implementation will work for basic testing if you implement these files as described. Here's how you can test it:

## Implementation Steps

1. **Create these files**:

   - `main.py` - FastAPI application (copy the API code)
   - `cli.py` - Command line interface (copy the CLI code)
   - `requirements.txt` - Dependencies:
     ```
     fastapi
     uvicorn
     requests
     questionary
     pydantic
     ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Testing Procedure

### 1. Start the API Server

```bash
uvicorn main:app --reload
```

- The API will run at `http://localhost:8000`
- You can visit `http://localhost:8000/docs` for Swagger UI

### 2. Run the CLI in another terminal

```bash
python cli.py
```

- Follow the interactive prompts to create a task

### 3. Manual API Testing

You can also test directly with curl:

```bash
# Create task
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/tasks/" \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-d '{
    "title": "Sample Task",
    "description": "This is a test task",
    "requirements": ["Requirement 1", "Requirement 2"],
    "language": "python"
}'

# Get task (replace {task_id} with actual ID)
curl "http://localhost:8000/tasks/{task_id}"
```

## Expected Behavior

1. The CLI will:

   - Ask mandatory questions first (title, description, requirements, language)
   - Then offer optional fields
   - Finally submit to the API

2. The API will:
   - Validate all input data
   - Store tasks in memory (will persist until server restarts)
   - Return properly formatted JSON responses

## Limitations to Note

1. **Persistence**: Tasks are stored in memory and will be lost when server stops
2. **Authentication**: No security implemented (fine for local testing)
3. **Error Handling**: Basic validation but no advanced error recovery

## Suggested First Test

1. Run the CLI and create a simple task with just required fields
2. Verify it appears in the API responses
3. Then try adding optional fields
4. Finally test invalid inputs to see validation messages

Would you like me to provide any additional test cases or explain any part of the testing process in more detail?
