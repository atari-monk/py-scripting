For your project structure, here's where and how to handle the `requirements.txt`:

## Recommended Location

Place it in the **root directory** of your repository (`C:\atari-monk\code\py-scripting\requirements.txt`) since it affects the entire project.

```
py-scripting/
├── .gitignore
├── requirements.txt  # <-- HERE
├── task_system/
│   ├── api/
│   ├── cli/
│   └── ...
└── ...other folders...
```

## Contents of requirements.txt

```text
# Core requirements
fastapi>=0.95.2
uvicorn>=0.22.0
pydantic>=2.0

# CLI-specific
questionary>=1.10.0
requests>=2.28.2

# Development extras (optional)
pytest>=7.2.0
httpx>=0.24.0
```

## Alternative Approach (For Multiple Components)

If you prefer component-specific requirements:

1. **Root requirements.txt** (Minimal cross-component requirements)

   ```text
   pydantic>=2.0
   ```

2. **task_system/requirements-api.txt**

   ```text
   fastapi>=0.95.2
   uvicorn>=0.22.0
   ```

3. **task_system/requirements-cli.txt**
   ```text
   questionary>=1.10.0
   requests>=2.28.2
   ```

Then install with:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install -r task_system/requirements-api.txt
pip install -r task_system/requirements-cli.txt
```

## Best Practice Notes

1. **Version Pinning**: Use `>=` for minimum versions rather than exact pins (`==`) unless you need reproducibility

2. **Development vs Production**: You might want separate:

   - `requirements-dev.txt` (testing, linting tools)
   - `requirements.txt` (production dependencies)

3. **Consider Poetry/Pipenv**: For larger projects, these tools handle dependencies better than plain requirements.txt

Would you like me to provide a more detailed breakdown of the dependencies or suggest any additional tools for dependency management?
