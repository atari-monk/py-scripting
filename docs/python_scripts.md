# Python Scripts

## They way of using scripts

- This is very important
- In root folder are scripts folders: root/scripts, ..., root/django_scripts
- Many a times i wrote wrappers with menus to run scripts
- This run script wrappers made me loose the plot every time
- DONT DO THEM UNLESS MUCH LATER AT MATURITY OF SCRIPTS
- also i dont want to use subprocess to run them scripts in batch, better keep it one by one
- run one script and process changes, is a fine rule
