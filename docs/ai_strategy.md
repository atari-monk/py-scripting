# AI Strategy

## Basic

AI is amazing.  
Basic strategy is to write quality prompt.  
Get response, read it refine it until it meets requirements.
Store it in markdown in docs/history/00n_name of the project.
Implement it, test it, repeat till project is done.

## Advanced

Basic strategy only works for one dev.  
Maybe using more structured approach would allow for automation to augment dev ?
