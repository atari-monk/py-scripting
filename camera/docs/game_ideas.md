Here are some simple game ideas you could create using your blue ball detector:

### 1. **Paddle Ball (Breakout-style)**

- _Concept_: Use the blue ball as a paddle at the bottom of the screen to bounce a virtual ball and break blocks at the top.
- _Implementation_:
  - Track the blue ball's x-position to move the paddle.
  - Add a small circle (ball) that bounces around, controlled by physics (angle changes on paddle hit).
  - Draw colored rectangles at the top that disappear when hit by the ball.

### 2. **Target Practice**

- _Concept_: Move the blue ball to "shoot" at targets that appear randomly on the screen.
- _Implementation_:
  - Spawn target circles/rectangles at random positions.
  - When the blue ball overlaps a target (collision detection), increment the score and spawn a new target.
  - Add a timer for a challenge.

### 3. **Maze Game**

- _Concept_: Navigate the blue ball through a maze to reach a goal.
- _Implementation_:
  - Draw a maze (lines or walls) on the screen.
  - The player must move the blue ball without touching the walls.
  - Add a finish zone (e.g., a green circle) to complete the level.

### 4. **Avoid the Obstacles**

- _Concept_: Dodge falling obstacles by moving the blue ball left/right.
- _Implementation_:
  - Spawn rectangles or circles falling from the top of the screen.
  - The player must avoid them by moving the blue ball.
  - Speed increases over time for difficulty.

### 5. **Color Catcher**

- _Concept_: Catch falling objects of a specific color while avoiding others.
- _Implementation_:
  - Spawn falling shapes with different colors (e.g., catch only green, avoid red).
  - Use the blue ball as a basket. Score increases for correct catches, decreases for wrong ones.

### 6. **Drawing/Tag**

- _Concept_: Use the blue ball to "draw" on the screen or tag moving objects.
- _Implementation_:
  - Track the blue ball's path and draw a line behind it.
  - Alternatively, have moving objects that must be "tagged" by touching them with the ball.

### 7. **Whack-a-Mole**

- _Concept_: Hit targets (e.g., red circles) that pop up randomly.
- _Implementation_:
  - Spawn targets at random positions for a short time.
  - The player must move the blue ball over them to "whack" them before they disappear.

### 8. **Follow the Trail**

- _Concept_: Trace a path or stay within a moving track.
- _Implementation_:
  - Draw a winding path (e.g., a moving snake-like line).
  - The player must keep the blue ball inside the path as it moves.
