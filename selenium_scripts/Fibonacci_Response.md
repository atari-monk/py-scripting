```python
def fibonacci(n):
    a, b = 0, 1
    for _ in range(n):
        a, b = b, a + b
    return a
```
Sure! Could you please provide the code or function that you'd like me to write an automatic unit test for?
Understood! Here's the code:

```python
import numpy as np

def calculate_mean(arr):
    return np.mean(arr)

data = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
mean_value = calculate_mean(data)
print(mean_value)
```
